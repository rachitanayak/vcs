# Version Control System
The main aim of this project is to design and implement a user-friendly version control system that allows users to edit a file and track its versions. A copy of the file is given to each user, they modify it over time by adding or deleting lines and commit to produce their final copy. This is achieved by using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI presents a text editor wherein a user can open the file and implement version control principles and perform related operations.The GUI is created using Qt Creator and the code is implemented in C++.  
Qt Creator Version-4.9.0(Community)
